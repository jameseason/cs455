# CS 455 - Cybersecurity
Contains assignments from CS455. 

## Hill cipher
Instructions: Using your choice of language, implement Hill cipher algorithm. The input to your program would be a key matrix (make it capable of dealing 
with 2X2 and 3X3 key matrix). Your program shall then ask if the user wanted to encrypt or decrypt, based on the choice it shall then accept either
plain text or cipher text and output the corresponding plain or cipher text. Remember not to use any special packages for matrix calculations. 
Also, make sure to implement the concept of padding in case the input is not long enough. Submit the source code and print screens of a sample run

## Playfair cipher
Instructions: Using your choice of language, implement playfair cipher algorithm. The input to your program would be a key word. 
Your program shall then ask if the user wanted to encrypt or decrypt, based on the choice it shall then accept either plain text or cipher text 
and output the corresponding text. Make sure to implement padding wherever required. Submit the source code and print screens of a sample run.
